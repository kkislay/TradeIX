The tests are placed in java-client.src.test.java.io.swagger.client.api folder
All the tests are written in PetApiTest.java file.
To run the tests, I have used cucumberRunner class. Reason is that it is good for reporting. Reports are saved in reports folder. Open index.html to view the reports.
I have used JUnit, cucumber to run the tests.
Feature file is located into features folder. Pet.feature includes all the Scenarios and test steps.
I have used Gradle and Maven for project framework support.
POM.xml has all the dependencies listed out.
